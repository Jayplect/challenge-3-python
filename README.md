## Desciption
Built a script to analyze financial records from a bank and to help modernize a rural town vote-counting process.

## Libraries used
  import os
  
  import csv
  
### Summary of Dataset

The financial dataset called budget_data.csv is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses".

Whereas, the poll data called election_data.csv comprised of three columns namely: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". 

Both datasets are delimited by commas

## Scripting
###### Below are some scripts used for the vote-counting analysis:

iterate through each row in data to count total votes and grep a list of candidates

      for row in csvreader:

          #count the total votes
          total_votes += 1

          #list of candidates
          candidate_list.append(row[2])
          
 iterate through the list of candidates, store unique names in a dictionary and corresponding votes
 
     for i in range(len(candidate_list)):
        
        #create a key for each candidate to store votes casted
        if (candidate_list[i]) not in candidate_names:
            candidate_names.append(candidate_list[i])
            
            #assign a value of zero to each key (i.e., candidate)
            candidate_votes[candidate_list[i]] = 0

        #add a value of 1 to each vote counted
        candidate_votes[candidate_list[i]] = candidate_votes[candidate_list[i]] + 1  
        
  export summary of results to a text file
  
      #text file with results from analysis
    with open(os.path.join("analysis", "Summary.txt"), "w") as txtfile:
        txtfile.write("Election Results" + "\n")
        txtfile.write("-------------------------------------" + "\n")
        txtfile.write("Total Votes:" + " " + str(total_votes) + "\n")
        txtfile.write("-------------------------------------" + "\n")

        #simultaneously iterate each through candidate votes and percentage
        for (candidate,votepercent) in zip(candidate_votes,votepercent_list):

            #print each unique candidate, their votes and vote percent
            txtfile.write(str(candidate)+":" + " "+ str(votepercent) + "%" + " "+ "("+ str(candidate_votes[candidate]) +             ")" + "\n")

        #write to text file the winner
        txtfile.write("-------------------------------------" + "\n")
        txtfile.write("Winner:" + " " + str(winner_name) + "\n")
        txtfile.write("-------------------------------------" + "\n")
        txtfile.close()
